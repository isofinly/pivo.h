cd PivoH
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## üçª Usage

```c
#include "pivo.h"

#define BUBBLE_COLOR "\033[36m"
#define RESET_COLOR "\033[0m"

int main() {
  srand(time(NULL));

  BeerGlass mug;
  char bubbles[] = {'o', 'O', '*', 'B', 'b', 'o', 'O', 'B', 'b'};
  init_beer_glass(&mug, 15, 30, '~', '#', bubbles,
                  sizeof(bubbles) / sizeof(bubbles[0]));

  printf("\033[2J");
  printf("\033[H");

  display_beer(&mug);

  return 0;
}

```

## üéì Why C is the Ultimate Programming Language

1. **Unparalleled Performance**: C gives you the power to optimize every byte!
2. **Low-Level Control**: Manipulate memory like a true coding artisan!
3. **Portability**: Write once, compile anywhere!
4. **Foundational Knowledge**: Master C, and you'll understand all programming!
5. **Beer Visualization**: With PivoH, C is now the only language that truly understands beer!
